## What is this project?

This is a simple one-page Todo application that allows you to manage your tasks.

Your tasks are displayed in three columns:

- Todo: tasks you have not started yet
- Doing: tasks you are currently working on
- Done: tasks you have already completed

You can add new tasks, edit existing ones, and delete tasks.
The app uses your browser's localStorage to save tasks, so your data will not be lost after refreshing the page.
